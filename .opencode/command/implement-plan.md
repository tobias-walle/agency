Implement the plan $ARGUMENTS.

1. Start by creating a TODO list (which also includes checks at various checkpoints)
2. As the last step in your TODO list, always check all the finished tasks in the PLAN and add implementation notes (About problems and derivations. Also things that went well. Keep them concise.)
3. Remember to update the `AGENTS.md` if the project structure or dependencies are changing

If not plan is provided, just tell the user that he needs to provide a plan like this `/implement-plan $PLAN`
