1. Determine the plan you are working on, based on your context (If you cannot detect the plan, tell the user that and stop here)
2. Update the plan in the following way:
   - Check all checkboxes of things that are completed
   - Add relevant notes in the plan that are relevant for future developers. Focus on problems you had with the original plan, plan changes or implementation details you didn't consider orginally.
   - Add or update the steps of the Detailed Plan if something was missed in the original planning
3. Do not commit. Hand control back to the user.
