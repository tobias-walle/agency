Commit the current changes.

- Follow Conventional Commits (e.g. `feat: add new feature`)
- Keep most commits in a single line. Only use the body if there are unexpected changes in the commit.

- Summarize the changes into a single sentence, starting with a lowercase verb.
- The sentence should cover why the changes were made.
- NEVER add semicolons in the message and keep the title shorter than 80 chars.
- Don't add a commit body or footer
- You might want to create multiple commits if the changes are not related.

- Include the current chat history as context
